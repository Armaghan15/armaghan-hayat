OK! Error and bugs. So, bugs are basically errors, like some frustrating errors. There is not even a single developer who wants a buggy code or wants to face errors while working on a project. Sometimes I myself feel that I am weaker than a spider. I mean common, it's a feast for spiders when they see bugs but developers, huh, we cry! The biggest mistake most people make while solving problems is not understanding the problem. The most powerful weapon a person has while solving a problem is the understanding of that problem. We don't realize it, but most of the time, we don't even know what is the actual problem. Bugs and errors can sometimes be fun too. As John Carmack says, "My code never has bugs. It just develops random unexpected features". Bugs can sometimes turn into amazing features (NOT GONNA HAPPEN EVERY TIME, BELIEVE ME). But the biggest advantage of having bugs and errors is that you always get a lesson or something to learn about. That's why I say, "If coding is water for programmers, then bugs are the sunlight".
